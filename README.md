# Optical-Charcter-Recognition
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the process that converts an image of text into a machine-readable text format. For example, if you scan a form or a receipt, your computer saves the scan as an image file. You cannot use a text editor to edit, search, or count the words in the image file.

# Multi Layer Perceptron

newp: Creates a perceptron
- Perceptrons are used to solve simple (i.e. linearly separable) classification problems.
- Perceptrons can classify linearly separable classes in a finite amount of time. If input vectors have a large variance in their lengths, the learnpn can be faster than learnp.
